*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"
My journey into programming started ambiguously, sparked by a simple piece of advice. The learning process spanned about three years, interspersed with breaks and moments of doubt about my compatibility with the field. However, the undeniable satisfaction from completing tasks and projects kept me going. I initially explored JavaScript but soon shifted my focus to Java, choosing to specialize and grow in one language among the myriad available. My path into backend development became clear after randomly encountering a Java tutorial, leading me to start with Java and then transition to front-end development with TypeScript."* :bowtie:

#### :sunny:Talking about my hobbies, I enjoy: 

- Watching streams – usually checking out games like Among Us, where player can be the sneaky imposter and create some fun chaos.
- Occasionally, video games provide me a great way to unwind. I've spent a lot of time playing World of Warcraft and Apex Legends.
- Hitting the gym not only makes me strong but also clears my mind. I highly recommend it to everyone!
