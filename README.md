*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How I started programming... Well, there's no clear answer here, I think it all began with a friendly piece of advice. Learning programming... about 3 years with breaks. Each time, it felt like it might not be my thing. Yet, the genuine joy that came from completing a task or project was undeniable. I initially dipped my toes into JavaScript, but I eventually pivoted towards Java. I knew one thing for sure - there are countless programming languages out there, and I wanted to pick one and commit to growing within it. At that point, I was clueless about languages, so I stumbled upon a random Java tutorial video - a clear decision was made to delve into the world of backend development."* :bowtie:

### :sunny:Talking about my hobbies, I enjoy: 

- Watching streams – usually checking out games like Among Us, where player can be the sneaky imposter and create some fun chaos.
- Occasionally, video games provide me a great way to unwind. I've spent a lot of time playing World of Warcraft and Apex Legends.
- Hitting the gym not only makes me strong but also clears my mind. I highly recommend it to everyone!
